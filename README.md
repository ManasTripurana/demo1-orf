# demo1-orf
this is a repo for reading orfs from a dna seq
i have used chatgpt this morning i.e. 28-08-2025 to make a orf code that takes fasta file in importing google colab 
i have given the logic to take seq and read until aug is acheived, from there go on till stop codon is acheived and do this until; all the n number of strings is complketed with multiple orf strngs
